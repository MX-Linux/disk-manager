# disk-manager

###  Disk Manager is a simple graphical filesystem mount tool and fstab editor that allows you to:
  * Mount/unmount internal filesystems
  * Add mounted filesystems to fstab
  * Specify filesystem mount options.
  * Enable/disable write support for NTFS (needs ntfs-3g installed).
  

***This version is a updated fork of the original abandoned disk-manager application.***
