# disk-manager

###  Disk Manager is a simple filesystem configurator that allows you to:
  * Automatically detect new partitions at startup.
  * Fully manage configuration of filesystem mount options.
  * Enable/disable write support for NTFS (needs ntfs-3g installed).

***This version is a updated fork of the original abandoned disk-manager application.***
