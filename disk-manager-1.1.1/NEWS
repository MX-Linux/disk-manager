* Fix : regression in question dialogs return code.
* Fix : in handl_umount_error, searching used file could hanged while waiting for network reply.
* Fix : LVM detection (LP #120455). The problem was that LVM configuration use a symlink
that we didn't list. Instead of trying to maintain a list of symlink for each devices, which is
difficult, we now resolve this symlink at Fstab creation to know if it refer to a known device.
* Change : options and type of mounted but not configured partitions are now initialized
with what give us MTAB instead of initialized them with default options.
* Change : Don't allow to change system partition mount point or to unmount them with the
lazy option, but allow them to be enable if they are not in FSTAB.
* Change : Some little performance improvement by refactoring the Entry copy method.
* Translation : 
- Some new translations, and update. Thank you for your hard work.
- POT status : 1 string added (this is in fact one that i forgot to make translatable).
